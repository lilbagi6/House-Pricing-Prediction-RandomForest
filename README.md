# 🏠 House Price Prediction using RandomForest

This project is a part of my Kaggle learning journey and demonstrates a basic regression model using the **RandomForestRegressor** from `scikit-learn` to predict housing prices.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- **Goal**: Predict final sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa.
- **Approach**: Use a Random Forest model to handle tabular data with mixed types and missing values.
